# Introduction to Decorators - Tutorial given at PyCon Online 2020

This repository contains supporting material for the **Introduction to Decorators - Power Up Your Python Code** tutorial I presented at the [Pycon Online 2020](https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/) conference.

The tutorial is available as a video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8CQwGIsrx4). 


## Exercises

The course is organized around 6 different exercises that show different techniques for constructing decorators in Python. For each exercise, your task is to implement a decorator that makes the given code run properly. The code for each exercise is available below:

- [Exercise 1](code/task01.py): Your first decorator: `@timer`
- [Exercise 2](code/task02.py): A decorator that use the function arguments: `@trace`
- [Exercise 3](code/task03.py): A decorator that don't wrap the original function: `@register`
- [Exercise 4](code/task04.py): A decorator that keep state: `@count_calls`
- [Exercise 5](code/task05.py): A decorator with arguments: `@use_units`
- [Exercise 6](code/task06.py): A decorator with optional arguments: `@supertrace`

See the table of contents below for links to each exercise in the video.


## Tutorial Content

The tutorial is divided into four main sections. Each of these explain several concepts, and give you some exercises to work through. I recommend that you code along during the video, and stop the video when necessary - and in particular for the exercises - to try out code for your self.

The following list contains links directly to the different sections in the video:
